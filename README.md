# Snake Game

## Game Description
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in C++. There are two game modes available:

- **With Wall**: In this mode, if the snake hits the wall, it dies.
- **Without Wall**: In this mode, the snake will not hit the border of the screen but will die if its head hits its tail.

As the snake moves, it consumes fruits that appear randomly on the screen. Each fruit consumed increases the size of the snake and the player's score.

- **W**: Move Up
